1 | An Amazon CloudWatch Events event calls the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function at 8 PM every day Monday through Saturday.
2 | The salesAnalysisReport Lambda function invokes another Lambda function, salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor, to retrieve the report data.
3 | The salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor function runs an analytical query against the caf√© database (cafe_db).
4 | The query result is returned to the salesAnalysisReport function.
5 | The salesAnalysisReport function formats the report into a message and publishes it to the salesAnalysisReportTopic Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.
6 | The salesAnalysisReportTopic SNS topic sends the message by email to the administrator.
